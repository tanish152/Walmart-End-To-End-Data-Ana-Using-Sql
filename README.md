# Walmart-End-To-End-Data-Ana-Using-Sql
 
    Welcome to the Walmart End-to-End Data Analysis Using SQL project! This repository showcases a comprehensive data analysis pipeline designed to extract actionable insights from Walmart sales data. Leveraging SQL, this project explores sales trends, customer behavior, and branch performance to optimize business strategies. The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition, providing a rich foundation for real-world retail analysis.

  # 📍 Project Overview
     This project demonstrates a full end-to-end data analytics pipeline with Walmart's sales dataset:

     Data Extraction: Acquire raw data via CSV or API.

     Data Cleaning / Transformation: Standardize, clean, and enrich via Python or SQL.

    Data Loading: Build operational/staging tables, apply star schema or relational model.

     Analysis & Insights: Use SQL to derive meaningful insights—e.g., performance by branch, sales trends, customer segmentation.

# Tech Stack

    SQL: Core language for querying, transforming, and analyzing data.
    
    MySQL/PostgreSQL: Relational database management systems for data storage and manipulation.
    
    GitHub: Version control and project hosting.
    
    Data Source: Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition dataset.(Using API ->settings-generate token->       make new folder(.kaagle) in your pc c/username-> place token in that folder)

#    🔄 ETL & Data Modeling Process
   Data Loading

    Import raw dataset into SQL staging tables.

Data Cleaning

    Remove duplicates, address missing values.
      
    Standardize data types and correct format issues.

Feature Engineering

    Create derived columns: day_name, month, time_of_day, total_amount = unit_price × quantity, etc. 

Data Modeling

    Choose relational or star schema.

    Build fact table(s): sales, revenue, quantity sold.

     Set up dimension tables: branch, product, date/time, customer_type.

Data Loading

    Use Python scripts or SQL INSERT…SELECT to populate analytical tables.

Analytical SQL

    Business queries using GROUP BY, top-selling products, busiest day/shift, revenue change analysis
